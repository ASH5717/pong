# pong
I made this game without tutorial
it works fine in pycharm but in vs code its kind a slow
each the a player hit the ball it speeds up
there is a thing that if you hit the ball by using the top or bottom of the rectangle the ball speed increases like 10 times
ITS A FEATURE NOT A BUG ;)
there is no end in this game.
